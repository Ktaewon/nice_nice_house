## 서비스 기획 배경 및 소개

Are there any areas in the student's identity where public data can be used to improve the quality of life?

Is there any way to revive the economy that has been stagnated in the long term due to the corona virus?

Our idea came from these two questions.
It's a **"nice and nice house".**

"**Nice and Nice House**" is an app that introduces cheap but good quality and hygienic restaurants. (To be expanded to all industries in the future)

Introduce :
Just because the price is good doesn't mean you can trust everyone. It analyzes good prices and Google ratings as well as information on safe businesses to introduce businesses that can provide both cost-effectiveness and quality to customers.
You can expect to revitalize the local economy by introducing good businesses to the economy that is stagnating due to the covid19-virus.
